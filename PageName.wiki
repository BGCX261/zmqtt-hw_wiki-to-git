MQTT is a lightweight message passing protocol.


= Configuring zmqtt =


mod_mqtt -> start_broker -> true
mod_mqtt -> port -> some_value
mod_mqtt -> allow_anonymous -> some_boolean
mod_mqtt -> username -> some_value
mod_mqtt -> password -> some_value

When a client is connecting to a broker from the same same site, it can use the site's config variables for username and password, so the call is simply connect(Context).

! The data in the packets including the username and password are not encrypted.
